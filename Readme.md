# Advisor list

The application is developed from scratch not using `create-react-app` tool, which is officially deprecated by React team.
For initial rendering I have chosen to generate content on the server side and then to load a client side script to execute hydration and make web page interactive.

This approach offers better initial load time and search engine optimization (SEO) compared to CSR.
The app can be changed to CSR easily with fetching advisor list from the client side. To show a loading state I would use Suspense built-in React component.

## What has been done

* Sort advisors by number of reviews
* Filter advisors by status and language
* Nice look and feel
* Basic testing
* Use a node.js server to serve data to the client
* Provide basic documentation: how to run the app, what trade-offs were made and why
* Advanced tests: user interactions
* Write in typescript in strict mode
* Support IE11
* set up CI on Github Actions for PRs

Here is how the app looks like:

## Prerequisites

The application requires Node v18.0.0, npm v9.6.1, Docker Desktop, MongoDB Compass.

## Installation

Install it from GitHub using the following commands
* `git clone git@github.com:allinne/advisor-list.git`
* `cd advisor-list`
* `npm i` install all dependencies

## Running / Development

* `docker-compose up` start Docker with MongoDB
* `npm run dev:server` launch the backend
* open MongoDB Compass
* `npx tsnd src/dev/load-test-data.ts` fill database with autogenerated data
* `npm run dev:bundler`launch the frontend
* visit the app at [http://0.0.0.0:8080](http://0.0.0.0:8080)

## Running Tests

* `npm run test` unit and integration tests
* `npm run cypress` e2e tests

## Linting

* `npm run lint:js`

## TODO
* add Reset filtering and sorting button
* add sorting by Advisor Name
* use `renderToPipeableStream` instead of `renderToString`. Streaming method can stream content in chunks as it resolves on the server so that the user sees the page being progressively filled in before the client code loads. It would be cruical for unlimited scrolling of advisors.
